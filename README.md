# Rainbow-Cats-Farming-Simulator
A cute farming simulator that can plant crops and construct buildings using Google Cardboard VR

Hi there!
I made a farming simulator using Google XR, C# and Unity3D.
Its not totally completed yet, but I have finished the basic systems that can be used in the game.
Have fun!
